The dominant event across different scenarios presented is a U.S. recession…but the timing of this break, the path of Fed policy and the reverberations for the rest of the world vary,” added Kasman.\n","* Goldman Sachs says: The fourth step requires softer wage growth to bring inflation back to target..This should get underway in 2023 but will take longer..We expect core PCE inflation to fall from roughly 5% to 3% by December 2023, driven largely by goods categories where supply chain recovery is now reversing pandemic shortages..Services inflation is likely to fall meaningfully in the official data only with a longer lag, especially in the largest categories, shelter and health care..\n","* EM ex-China and Turkey inflation is expected to halve to 4.3% by end-2023 compared with 7.9% in end-2022..“Inflation is expected to remain a problem for central banks in roughly half of the core EM countries..Some EM central banks may start easing next year but most look set to keep rates high for longer,” said Luis Oganes, Head of Currencies, Commodities and Emerging Markets Research at J.P. Morgan..JPMorgan says:  Stubbornly high inflation, continued USD strength and a broader tightening in global financial conditions mean easing cycles are only expected to get underway in Latin America, Czechia and India..\n","* Goldman Sachs says: The third step requires labor market rebalancing to slow wage growth. Wage growth has begun to moderate in recent months, and we expect it to fall to 4% by the end of 2023, not far above our 3.5% estimate of the pace compatible with 2% inflation. If so, this intermediate step would provide crucial early support for the view that overheating can be reversed without a recession.\n","* Goldman Sachs says: US Economics Analyst 2023 US Economic Outlook: Approaching a Soft Landing.  The key macroeconomic question of the year has been whether inflationary overheating can be reversed without a recession. Our analysis suggests that the answer is yes—an extended period of below-potential growth can gradually reverse labor market overheating and bring down wage growth and ultimately inflation, providing a feasible if challenging path to a soft landing. The initial steps along this path have been successful, but there is much further to go in 2023. We expect another year of below-potential growth and labor market rebalancing to solve much but not all of the underlying inflation problem. Unlike consensus, we do not expect a recession. \n","* n We expect the FOMC to slow the pace of rate hikes as it shifts to fine-tuning the funds rate to keep growth below potential, but to ultimately deliver a bit more than is priced, with a 50bp hike in December and three 25bp hikes next year raising the funds rate to a peak of 5-5.25%..Our recession odds are below consensus even though our Fed forecast is slightly more hawkish than consensus because we expect demand to prove more resilient than expected next year.\n","* Morgan Stanley says:  In an environment of slow growth, lower inflation and new monetary policies, expect 2023 to have upside for bonds, defensive stocks and emerging markets. Investors may find themselves a bit whiplashed in 2023 as inflation and some of this year’s other dominant market trends fully reverse themselves, according to the 2023 Strategy Outlook from Morgan Stanley Research.  “For markets, this presents a very different backdrop than 2022, which was marked by resilient growth, high inflation and hawkish policy,” says Andrew Sheets, Chief Cross-Asset Strategist for Morgan Stanley Research. “Overall, 2023 will be a good year for income investing.” \n","* “The almost 500bp of expected cumulative hikes is already delivering a commensurate tightening of financial conditions, which we believe will tip the economy into a mild recession later next year..With a slowing in aggregate demand, we project the unemployment rate will rise to 4.3% by the end of next year,” said Jay Barry, Co-Head of U.S. Rates Strategy at J.P. Morgan..\n","\n","Question: what is outlook for inflation?\n","\n","###\n","\n","\n","Selected 10 document sections for Context:\n","27,28,30,29,2,31,8,18,12,20\n","\n","Full Prompt: \n","Given the following context, answer the question as truthfully as possible, and if the answer is not contained within the context below, say \"Sorry, I don't know.\"\n","\n","Context:\n","\n","* JPMorgan says:  Commodities Outlook..Entering 2022, the view was the global oil market would remain tight but balanced, with Brent averaging $90 per barrel (bbl) for the year..With the , J.P. Morgan Research opted to raise its 2022 average Brent price to $104/bbl and 2023 price to $98/bbl, with prices peaking in the second quarter of 2022 at $114/bbl..“After maintaining our price view for eight months, we now opt to shave $8 off our 2023 price projections, on our expectations that Russian production will fully normalize to pre-war levels by mid-2023..\n","* Despite more pessimistic expectations for balances over the next few months, we find the underlying trends in the oil market supportive and expect global Brent benchmark price to average $90/bbl in 2023 and $98/bbl in 2024,” said Natasha Kaneva, Head of Global Commodities Strategy at J.P. Morgan..\n","* There is still substantial room for a cyclical rebound, driven by a continued normalization of demand for mobility fuels like gasoline, diesel and jet fuel to pre-COVID levels.“Our forecast of a $90 Brent in 2023 centers on the view that the OPEC+ alliance (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies) will do the heavy lifting to keep markets balanced next year,” added Kaneva..On the structural side, expansion of the world’s oil supply growth is expected to slow in 2024, reviving the need for OPEC’s crude..\n","* JPMorgan says:  Commodity price forecasts 2023..Commodity price forecasts for 2023, with Brent averaging $90 per barrel, WTI averaging $83 and gold averaging $1,860 in the fourth quarter of 2023..There are strong reasons to expect a relatively robust 1.3 million barrels per day (mbd) of oil demand growth next year, despite expectations for the global economy to expand at a sub-par 1.5% pace in 2023..\n","* Morgan Stanley says: Other key takeaways from our 2023 Strategy Outlook: 10-year Treasury yields will end 2023 at 3.5% vs. a 14-year high of 4.22% in October 2022. With favorable pricing, securitized products, such as mortgage-backed securities, will offer upside. S&P 500 will tread water, ending 2023 around 3,900, but with material swings along the way. U.S. dollar will peak in 2022 and declines through 2023. Emerging-market and Japanese equities could deliver double-digit returns. Oil will outperform gold and copper, with Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, ending 2023 at $110.\n","* Growth from U.S. shale producers, traditionally the most responsive to changing market conditions, is expected to more than halve from 1.1-1.2 mbd this year and next to 0.5 mbd in 2024..\n","* “This should ultimately more than offset the 10% earnings-per-share decline we expect from weaker top-line growth and material margin disappointment,” says Graham Secker, Head of European and U.K. Equity Strategy..Financials and energy are more likely to perform well in this environment, he says..\n","* Tremors emanating from Emerging Market (EM) low-income commodity importers, U.K. pension funds and the U.S. crypto sector are not unrelated: they signal that rapidly tightening financial conditions generate stress that could spill over in ways that threaten macroeconomic stability..With the winter set to aggravate China’s COVID problems and Europe’s natural gas crisis, the global growth outlook remains depressed, but we do not see the global economy at imminent risk of sliding into recession in early 2023..The financial conditions drag is being cushioned by a fading of supply chain and commodity price shocks,” said Bruce Kasman, Head of Economic and Policy Research at J.P. Morgan..\n","* JPMorgan says: 2023 Market Outlook: Stocks Set to Fall Near-Term as Economic Growth Slows ..The global economy is projected to expand at a sluggish pace of around 1.6% in 2023 as financial conditions tighten, the winter aggravates China’s COVID policy and Europe’s natural gas problems persist..The global economy is not at imminent risk of sliding into recession, as the sharp decline in inflation helps promote growth, but the J.P. Morgan Research baseline view assumes a U.S. recession is likely before the end of 2023..\n","* JPMorgan says:  Stock Market Outlook.After a year of macroeconomic and geopolitical shocks, investors responded by derating the S&P 500 price to earnings (P/E) ratio as much as seven times, while some speculative growth segments crashed 70-80% from highs.\n","\n","Question: what is outlook for oil?\n","\n","###\n","\n","\n","Keyboard interruption in main thread... closing server.\n"]}],"source":["# Use OpenAI's prompt/completion approach to answer questions, using the Gradio interface \n","if use_interface:\n","    demo = gr.Interface(\n","    fn=lambda query: answer_query_with_context(query, df_excerpt, doc_embeddings),\n","    inputs=gr.Textbox(lines=2,  label=\"Query\", placeholder=\"Type Question Here...\"),\n","    outputs=gr.Textbox(lines=2, label=\"Answer\"),\n","    description=\"Example of a domain-specific chatbot, using ChatGPT with supplemental content and fine-tuning.<br>\\\n","                  Here, the content relates to the investment outlook for 2023, according to Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs.<br>\\\n","                  Sample queries: What is Goldman's outlook for inflation?

The dominant event across different scenarios presented is a U.S. recession…but the timing of this break, the path of Fed policy and the reverberations for the rest of the world vary,” added Kasman.\n","* Goldman Sachs says: The fourth step requires softer wage growth to bring inflation back to target..This should get underway in 2023 but will take longer..We expect core PCE inflation to fall from roughly 5% to 3% by December 2023, driven largely by goods categories where supply chain recovery is now reversing pandemic shortages..Services inflation is likely to fall meaningfully in the official data only with a longer lag, especially in the largest categories, shelter and health care..\n","* EM ex-China and Turkey inflation is expected to halve to 4.3% by end-2023 compared with 7.9% in end-2022..“Inflation is expected to remain a problem for central banks in roughly half of the core EM countries..Some EM central banks may start easing next year but most look set to keep rates high for longer,” said Luis Oganes, Head of Currencies, Commodities and Emerging Markets Research at J.P. Morgan..JPMorgan says:  Stubbornly high inflation, continued USD strength and a broader tightening in global financial conditions mean easing cycles are only expected to get underway in Latin America, Czechia and India..\n","* Morgan Stanley says:  In an environment of slow growth, lower inflation and new monetary policies, expect 2023 to have upside for bonds, defensive stocks and emerging markets. Investors may find themselves a bit whiplashed in 2023 as inflation and some of this year’s other dominant market trends fully reverse themselves, according to the 2023 Strategy Outlook from Morgan Stanley Research.  “For markets, this presents a very different backdrop than 2022, which was marked by resilient growth, high inflation and hawkish policy,” says Andrew Sheets, Chief Cross-Asset Strategist for Morgan Stanley Research. “Overall, 2023 will be a good year for income investing.” \n","* Goldman Sachs says: US Economics Analyst 2023 US Economic Outlook: Approaching a Soft Landing.  The key macroeconomic question of the year has been whether inflationary overheating can be reversed without a recession. Our analysis suggests that the answer is yes—an extended period of below-potential growth can gradually reverse labor market overheating and bring down wage growth and ultimately inflation, providing a feasible if challenging path to a soft landing. The initial steps along this path have been successful, but there is much further to go in 2023. We expect another year of below-potential growth and labor market rebalancing to solve much but not all of the underlying inflation problem. Unlike consensus, we do not expect a recession. \n","* Goldman Sachs says: The third step requires labor market rebalancing to slow wage growth. Wage growth has begun to moderate in recent months, and we expect it to fall to 4% by the end of 2023, not far above our 3.5% estimate of the pace compatible with 2% inflation. If so, this intermediate step would provide crucial early support for the view that overheating can be reversed without a recession.\n","* n We expect the FOMC to slow the pace of rate hikes as it shifts to fine-tuning the funds rate to keep growth below potential, but to ultimately deliver a bit more than is priced, with a 50bp hike in December and three 25bp hikes next year raising the funds rate to a peak of 5-5.25%..Our recession odds are below consensus even though our Fed forecast is slightly more hawkish than consensus because we expect demand to prove more resilient than expected next year.\n","* Upside and downside to this base case will largely depend on the depth and length of the recession and the speed of the Fed’s counter-response..Market volatility is also set to remain elevated (with the Volatility Index or VIX averaging around 25)..\n","\n","Question: what is the outlook for inflation?\n","\n","###\n","\n","\n","Selected 8 document sections for Context:\n","41,11,9,18,25,44,0,43\n","\n","Full Prompt: \n","Given the following context, answer the question as truthfully as possible, and if the answer is not contained within the context below, say \"Sorry, I don't know.\"\n","\n","Context:\n","\n","* JPMorgan:  Emerging Markets Outlook..At 2.9% in 2023, EM growth looks to remain well below its pre-pandemic trend, slowing modestly from 2022..EM excluding China is expected to slow to a below-trend 1.8% with wide regional divergences..In China, the full-year 2023 growth forecast is 4% year-over-year, where two quarters of below-trend growth are assumed as the economy loosens COVID restrictions..The global and U.S. economic cycles will remain the primary drivers for EM assets in 2023..\n","* Morgan Stanley says: Emerging market debt: Another potential bright spot, EM debt could benefit from a combination of trends—including declining rates, improving economic fundamentals and a weakening dollar.

Emerging market local currency denominated debt should see an even stronger total return of 18.3%.\n","* Morgan Stanley says:  This has been a major bear market for emerging market, but the tide could be turning, says Jonathan Garner, Chief Asia and Emerging Market Equity Strategist..“Valuations are clearly cheap, and cyclical winds are shifting in favor of emerging markets as global inflation eases more quickly than expected, the Fed stops hiking rates and the U.S. dollar declines,” he says, adding that over the last several economic cycles, emerging markets have recovered before U.S. markets..In particular, investors should keep an eye on Mid and large-cap companies: The MSCI EM, an index of mid and large-cap companies in 24 emerging markets, could see 12% price returns in 2023..\n","* Tremors emanating from Emerging Market (EM) low-income commodity importers, U.K. pension funds and the U.S. crypto sector are not unrelated: they signal that rapidly tightening financial conditions generate stress that could spill over in ways that threaten macroeconomic stability..With the winter set to aggravate China’s COVID problems and Europe’s natural gas crisis, the global growth outlook remains depressed, but we do not see the global economy at imminent risk of sliding into recession in early 2023..The financial conditions drag is being cushioned by a fading of supply chain and commodity price shocks,” said Bruce Kasman, Head of Economic and Policy Research at J.P. Morgan..\n","* JPMorgan says:  The convergence between the U.S. and international markets should continue next year, both on a USD and local currency basis..The S&P 500 risk-reward relative to other regions remains unattractive..Continental European equities have a likely recession to negotiate and geopolitical tail risks, but the eurozone has never been this attractively priced versus the U.S. Japan should be relatively resilient due to solid corporate earnings from the economy’s reopening, attractive valuation and smaller inflation risk compared with other markets.“Within developed markets, the U.K. is still our top pick..As for EM, its recovery is mostly linked to China..\n","* The rest of EM Asia, having lagged its EM peers in lifting off, is expected to stay on hold next year..“The global and U.S. economic cycles will remain the primary drivers for EM assets in 2023..The worst moves for EM risky asset classes are seen in U.S. recessions with large widening in credit spreads and lower equity prices..EM has historically followed these patterns and we expect higher risk premia into a U.S. recession, although the moves may be mitigated by the selloff already seen in 2022,” added Oganes..\n","* Morgan Stanley says:  In an environment of slow growth, lower inflation and new monetary policies, expect 2023 to have upside for bonds, defensive stocks and emerging markets.
